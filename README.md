This repo is to save analysis on Moz online product
The data set consists some categorical features on Moz customer's geo location, browser choice and industy and some numerical data on how long they use the product.
I started with data preprocess, feature engineer and exploratory data anaysis.
I then choose a linear model and tuned the hyper parameters.
There are also inferential interpretations and recommendations I discovered after training.
